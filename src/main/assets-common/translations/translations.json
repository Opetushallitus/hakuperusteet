This concerns applicants to both Bachelor's and Master's level studies. The application fee covers all the applications to Finnish higher education institutions that an applicant makes for study programmes that start in the same semester. <BR> The collection of application fees is based on the Universities Act and the Polytechnics Act. The fee is charged due to the administrative expenses caused by the verification work on qualifications completed outside EU/EEA countries or Switzerland and to develop the electronic application system. <BR>If you are required to pay the application fee, it needs to be paid before filling in the application. <BR>The application fee is collected by the Finnish National Board of Education. <BR>To get started, please sign in with your Google account or order a login link to your e-mail."
